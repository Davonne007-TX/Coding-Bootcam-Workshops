// Block 18 Workshop: Writing Test Specifications 

/* 
    Prompt 1 - A function called "multiplication" that returns
    the product of the two input numbers.

    Unit Tests:
    ==> Except a function to be an arrow function or with the key word function
    ==> Except the function to take two numbers as arguments, num1 and num2
    ==> Expect function to declare a variable that takes num1 and num2
     and multiplies them together
     ==> Expect function to return the variable that did the multiplication 
    ==> Expect to console.log the solution that invokes the function, and pass 
    the numbers 10 and 20
    ==> The value should be a number, should be 200
    ==> If value is not a number, do not run code
    ==> Expect to not run code if arguments are not numbers   
    ==> Expect to not run code if there is a syntax error
    ==> Expect to not run code if said declarations are not let, const or var


    Integration: 
    ==>If value is not a number, alert a message that says "Review your code"

/*Prompt 2 - A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments.
It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, 
from both of the arrays.
